# Fewbricks 

These files are only meant as a demo of what you can do with Fewbricks. There is absolutely no need to use it in this
 way. If you only want to use Fewbricks to register field groups and fields and don√§t use the Brick feature, that is 
 perfectly fine. If ypu don't want to use OPP the way it is used here, or if you don't want to use OOP at all, feel 
 free to use any other coding paradigm that you are comfortable with.
