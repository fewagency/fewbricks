Sometimes you may want to export the field groups that you have built using Fewbricks. That's why we included ways to do just that.

## Manual export
Check `wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=acf-field-group&page=fewbricksdev` of your WP installation for some export features.

## Auto export
Check the filter [fewbricks/exporter/php/auto_write_target](/filters/exporter--php--auto_write_target/) for more info.
