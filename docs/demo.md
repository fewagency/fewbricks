# Demo
Fewbricks comes with an extensive demo code base where we try to show everything that you can do with Fewbricks.

Start your journey in Fewbricks-land by heading to [https://github.com/folbert/fewbricks/tree/2.x/fewbricks-demo/init
.php](https://github.com/folbert/fewbricks/tree/2.x/fewbricks-demo/init.php) and start reading the code.

If you want to use the demo in a WordPress install of your own where you have [installed Fewbricks](/getting-started/), 
all you have to do is include the fewbricks-demo/init.php-file. Whether you move the demo directory to a place of 
your own or include it straight from the plugin directory is up to you. But if you plan to do a lot of editing to the
 demo files we suggest that you move the demo files out ofr the Fewbricks directory to  avoid overwriting your 
 changes if you update the plugin later on.
 
 After you have included the demo you should see two new post types in the admin area. These post types have their 
 very own template in order to work alongside any theme you might be running. The template includes everything from 
 &lt;html&gt; to &lt;/html&gt;.Don't forget to head to the  settings page for permalinks and hit save in order for the
  new post types to show up in the frontend.
