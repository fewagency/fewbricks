# Requirements

- PHP 7.1+

- WordPress :)

- [Advanced Custom Fields PRO 5](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com)

- Fewbricks Hidden Field for Advanced Custom Fields. This allows us to store settings for a brick. Install either 
from [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/folbert/acf-fewbricks-hidden) using Composer or teh good old standard
 WordPress way by [downloading it from GitHub](https://github.com/folbert/acf-fewbricks-hidden).

- Some experience with ACF and knowledge about what a field, field group etc is is recommended and that can all be read
up on in the [documentation for ACF](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources).
