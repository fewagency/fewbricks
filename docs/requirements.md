# Requirements

- PHP 7.1+

- WordPress :)

- [https://www.advancedcustomfields.com](Advanced Custom Fields 5+ PRO)

- [https://github.com/folbert/acf-fewbricks-hidden](Fewbricks Hidden Field for Advanced Custom Fields). This allows us to store settings in a brick. For example how many columns a multi column brick should have. Automatically installed if you use Composer.

- Some experience with ACF and knowledge about what a field, field group etc is is recommended and that can all be read up on in the [https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources](documentation for ACF).
