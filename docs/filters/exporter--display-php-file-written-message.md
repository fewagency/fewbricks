# Filters - fewbricks/exporter/display_php_file_written_message

```php
fewbricks/display_php_file_written_message
```

Have this filter return `false` to hide message in the admin area when the PHP code file has been written. If not
applied or set to return true, each page load in the admin area will generate a message telling you that the code has
been written to the file you have specified in  [auto_write_php_code_file](doc:auto_write_php_code_file).
